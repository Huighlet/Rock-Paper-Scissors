The solution to the Rock Paper Scissors work is in the branch rock-paper-scissors-solution. I uploaded the RPS.py file. I couldn't push from gitpod because the first push sent the initial file to the main without my modifications to the RPs.py file and the second push after creating the branch wouldn't go through because the i had an error with --set-upstream so i couldn't push and i had to upload from my computer after saving the code in a .py file using sublime before uploading. Thank you.
